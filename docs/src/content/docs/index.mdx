description: In this course we will build a Storyteller AI Large Language Model (LLM). Hand in hand, you'll be able create, refine and illustrate little stories with the AI. We are going to build everything end-to-end from basics to a functioning web app similar to ChatGPT, from scratch in Python, C and CUDA, and with minimal computer science prerequisits. By the end you should have a relatively deep understanding of AI, LLMs, and deep learning more generally.

    Starlight has been a game-changer for me, allowing me to focus on content creation.

    Its intuitive design not only streamlines my workflow but also reduces onboarding time for open-source developers.

    Spent some more time with Starlight for the Course Builder docs and it’s been great so far. Lots of nice touches and can focus on writing in Markdown and not fiddling with the site.

    I used Starlight in my last job and loved it. Great components, intuitive
    design, and super-responsive community (whenever anyone needed something,
    they’d ship it soonish or tell you a workaround). Very pleasant experience.

    Starlight is my go-to tool for documentation. It made it super easy to add docs to my existing Astro product website, vs needing a subdomain to use with another tool.
